# Social-Network-API


## Description

This is the back end API for a thought-based social network. Users will sign up with their email address and a custom, unique username. On the front end, users will be able to share short thoughts (280 characters max) with their in-app friends. Those friends will also be able to leave replies (called "reactions") to engage with the original poster.

For a short demonstration of the functionality of the back end using Insomnia, please click [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1birrkzkEBEopup6MKHZlIffGYigTIJZx/view?usp=sharing)
